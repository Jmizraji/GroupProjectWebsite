<p>Through academic and primary research, we have gained insight of our target audience (dominately 20-22 years of age and in college). The graphic below reflects our primary research via surveys to better understand the amount of sleep most people are getting and why their sleeping habits are poor (Sleep Pattern Survey).</p>

<p>Through the illustration of the most popular answers, we can conclude that there is a correlation between age, lack of sleep, and schedule responsibilities. This conclusion may seem vague but it allows us to better understand the audience that is being affected most by hectic schedules. Most respondents noted that they were students who were also either full-time or part-time employees. This in itself is an added stressor that is not typically seen outside of the ages of the twenties. This brings to our attention even more the importance of a high level of performance but also how the pressure of this in turn hurts performance.</p>

<p>This infographic provided us with a quick display of the adverse effects that lack of sleep can cause to the body. We were able to learn of some of the biggest risks to people. In as little as a week, people substantially increase their risk of health complications. For example, people who do not get a decent amount of sleep during the night will not experience a natural drop in blood pressure that is necessary to keep the body healthy. This increases the risk for diabetes ("Dangers of Sleep Deprivation").</br>

<p>This graphic not only focuses on health problems correlated with lack of sleep, but also dangerous effects such as falling asleep while driving. For example, there are 100,000 automobile accidents annually that are related to drowsy driving ("The Waking Dead"). Companies lose out of productivity when employees are not getting enough sleep and are unable to function at high performance skill levels. Mortality risks increase as sleep decreases, yet high percentages of teens and adults get substantially less hours of sleep throughout the week than necessary for their age group.
