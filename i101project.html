<h3 align="center"> Problem Statement </h3> 
<p align="center">Sleep deprivation is a major concern for adolescents and adults today.  Most individuals are unaware of how many hours of sleep they need, the quality of sleep they are getting, and how to time manage their day in order to get the best sleep possible. <br />
Through a range of surveys and previous studies, we decided to try and tackle this problem first hand. We are in the process of creating an app that would help individuals prioritize their life to obtain a healthy sleep cycle.  </p>
<h3 align="center">How We Selected Our Problem</h3>
<p align="center">As college students, we were able to recognize a common problem among our peers, and ourselves, of lack of sleep due to hectic schedules. By using a survey we created, we were able to expand our knowledge to confirm how broad of a problem sleep deprivation is among adults in general and not just college students.</p>
<h3 align="center"> Basic Information about Sleep Deprivation </h3>
<div align="center">
  <ul> 
    <li> Students spend about a third of their life sleeping </li>
    <li> Individuals with anxiety or depression are more prone to sleep disturbances </li>
    <li> Adolescents need about 8.5 to 9.25 hours a sleep a night to function best </li>
    <li> Victims of sleep deprivation increase their risks for heart disease, injury, breast cancer, and diabetes. </li>
  </ul>
