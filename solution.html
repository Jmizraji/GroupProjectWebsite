Through our research, and simply being busy college students, we have realized there is a severe lack of sleep among students and individuals alike. We hope that our solution will provide an outlet to better help individuals (predominately adults, but across any spectrum of careers/lifestyles/education etc.) manage their time accordingly. With lack of sleep comes lack of focus and our goal is to help others gain a better sense of balance between demands, responsibilities and the key element of sleep.</br>

<h3>App Prototype:</h3>

<h3>How the app helps:</h3><br>
We focused on using technology to address our problem of sleep deprivation. In doing so, we have created the idea of a sleep app that lets users put in the information of their weekly schedules. The app processes the information and lets the user know how much sleep they need at minimum in order to function at a decent performance level.
The app is meant to be personalized by the user to fit his/her needs accordingly. As much as 60% of adults do not get enough sleep (Mueller). Along with sleep deprivation comes risk of health complications. When individuals sleep six hours, the risk of heart disease increases by 48% (Mueller). Anything less than seven hours of sleep can greatly impact health. The app is meant to help with time management in a way that lets users see exactly what they have time for. When individuals reach levels of low sleep, the app will notify them of the increasing health risks.</br>
<h3>How the app works:</h3>
The user puts in daily tasks in order of importance. The app will configure a time limit for each task to be completed. The primary goal of the app is to allow the user to see how much they can get done in the day without sacrificing sleep time. It may seem as though the app is just another calendar or organizer, but the app is intended to be much more interactive and personal. We can even go as far as imputing basic health information such as height, weight, gender and age. This will allow the app to better suit the user and his/her sleeping needs.</br>
