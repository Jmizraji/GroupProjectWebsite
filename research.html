This page presents the research we have conducted via scholarly articles, infographics and primary research. Our project was based on this research and supported our notion of the effects of sleep deprivation.</br>

<div class="bodycolor"> <ul><li><b>Title:</b> “Quick to berate, slow to sleep: Interpartner psychological conflict, mental health, and sleep.” </li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> Although this journal article from the American Psychological Association examines the health risks of interpartner psychological conflict it also examines the effect that this conflict has on individual sleep patterns, and subsequently the health problems and side effects that come with little sleep (El-Sheikh, Kelly, & Rauer, 1057). The article relates a study done on 135 cohabitating couples wherein the individual partners would wear actigraphs and complete questionnaires (El-Sheikh, Kelly, & Rauer, 1059). The study found that couples who had occurrences of interpartner psychological conflict were more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression which in turn had an effect on their ability to sleep. (El-Sheikh, Kelly, & Rauer, 1063). It was related early on in the article that this lack of sleep has been linked by other researchers to greater mortality risk, health complaints, and mood disturbances (El-Sheikh, Kelly, & Rauer, 1057).</li>

Title:</b> "Altered brain response to verbal learning following sleep deprivation"</li>

<li><b>Summary:</b> Effects of lack of sleep can be seen in place after one night of little sleep. Research was conducted on 13 relatively healthy individuals before and after sleep deprivation. Each person went 34.7 (+/- 1.5) hours without sleep. The primary focus was to measure cognitive effects. Contrary to hypothesis, certain areas of the brain experience higher activity when in a state of sleep deprivation. The areas of the brain that impact short-term memory and high cognitive loads were more active. Results also showed that individuals can compensate for sleep deprivation when starting a task, but after extensive time on the task, efforts become more difficult and SD is harder to fight.</li>

<ul><li><b>Title:</b> “Why Sleep Matters: Differences in Daytime Functioning Between Adolescents with Low and High Chronic Sleep Reduction and Short and Long Sleep Durations” </li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> This article conducts an experiment on adolescents to discover the effects of chronic sleep loss.  The researchers gave a sample size of 794 adolescents each an online questionnaire that measured chronic sleep reduction, depressive symptoms, attention problems, and school performance.  The results of the experiment “found significant differences in daytime functioning between the different groups, giving evidence of vulnerability to impaired daytime functioning due to (chronic) sleep loss” (Dewald-Kaufmann, 1).  Basically the less or worse quality of sleep the adolescents had, the more negatively affected their daytime functions were.</li>

<ul><li><b>Title:</b> “Exploring Interaction Strategies in the Context of Sleep” </li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> This journal article is written for the HCI community and places focus on "developing interaction technologies in the relatively unexplored area of sleep" (19). Despite its focus on HCI, the article examines sleep from many other vantage points including sociological, psychological, and physiological. In doing this, it provides a background and a context for the second part of the article which covers the challenges and opportunities that exist when designing technologies that are geared toward sleeping. </li>

<ul><li><b>Title:</b> <i>Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation: An Unmet Public Health Problem</i> </li>
<li><b>Summary:</b>  This book is an extraordinarily extensive examination of sleep, lack of sleep, and its disorders. It provides research into the ramifications of sleep deprivation, including physiological, functional, and economical. It also gives information on natural, healthy patterns of sleep. Additionally, it examines the present and future of somnology (the science of sleep) research and technology. </li>

<ul><li><b>Title:</b> "Unobtrusive Sleep Monitoring using Smartphones" </li>
<li><b>Summary:</b> This article examines the application of a research model in the field of sleep called BES (best effort sleep). Without the use of the restricting headbands necessary to other research models, BES is an unobtrusive method of inferring sleep patterns using environmental factors. By monitoring the light, sound, and stillness of an environment, along with recording its own usage, a smartphone is capable of gathering quite accurate records of sleep data. This concept of smartphone sleep monitoring is further researched through the examination of three existing smartphone applications. </li>

<h3>Survey Responses:</h3>
Our survey collected reponses from 61 individuals to access sleeping patterns. From that, we have decided to pull the answers of two individuals to exemplify variation in responses.</br>
</center>
<p>
<div class="survey">
<ol><h4>Respondent #53:</h4>
<li>20-22 years of age</li>
<li>5th year in college</li>

<li>Stress, school work, and busyness are prominent reasons for lack of sleep</li>
<li>Poor memory, lack of focus, and general sleepiness are most prominent effects of lack of sleep for this individual</li>
<li>The indivual does not feel his/her work and/or school activities suffer from lack of sleep</li>
<li>Naps and energy drinks are main sources used to combat sleepiness</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="survey1">

<li>Junior in college </li>

<li>Over-exhaustion is a prominent reason for lack of sleep </li>
<li>Exhausted body, general sleepiness, confusion, lack of focus, poor memory,  and poor motor skills are most prominent effcts of lack of sleep for this individual

</ol>
</center>

<div class="even">
Even though generally lack of sleep is a negative for people, some individuals do not feel that work and school suffer from it. Some are also able to use healthier means of dealing with sleepiness, such as short naps.
